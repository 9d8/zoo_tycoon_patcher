# Old Game Patches

A collection of patches that I have wrote for old video games. I mostly wrote
these for fun, education purposes, and because many of the patches I find online
for these games are closed source and a bit sketchy.

## Building

Just clone the repo and run make
```
git clone 
make
```

## Usage

See individual patch README's for instructions on how to use.

## List of patches

| Game | Patch | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Zoo Tycoon | CD-ROM Patch | Allows Zoo Tycoon to start without the CD-ROM inserted |
| Bubble Hero 2 | CD-ROM Patch | Allows Bubble Hero 2 to start without the CD-ROM inserted |
