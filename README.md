# Zoo Tycoon Patcher

This program will patch the CD-ROM version of the Zoo Tycoon: Complete Collection to run without the CD-ROM inserted in your computer. To be used on your legitimate copy of the game. It may work on other editions of the game, I just never tried it.

I wrote this program because all of the existing Zoo Tycoon exe patches I could find were closed source and a bit sketchy.

## Building

Just clone the repo and run make
```
git clone 
make
```

## Usage

To use, run the patcher on your `zoo.exe` file.

```
zoo_tycoon_patcher /path/to/my/zoo.exe
```
